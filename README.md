Welcome to **around-the-world** repository! This project combines optimization, geography, and exploration. The goal? To determine how quickly one can circumnavigate the globe, starting and ending at a chosen point, while visiting nearby cities and adhering to constraints like distance, population, a change in country and most importantly, travel direction.
Please vist [The Journey App](http://13.49.21.144:8501) for an interactive experience of the final result.

## üîç About

The project explores the feasibility of completing a journey around the world starting from a specific point while calculating the minimum travel time between cities under defined constraints. It leverages Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm and k-dimensional trees (k-D trees), to optimize the travel path efficiently.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/max-mind/world-cities-database?select=worldcitiespop.csv) used consists of major cities worldwide, with the assumption that travel is always possible to a number of nearest neighbors (default is 3) either eastward or westward. Constraints are customizable, but the default configuration includes the following:
-	**Base Travel Times**:
    -	2 hours to the nearest city.
    - 4 hours to the second nearest city.
    - 8 hours to the third nearest city.
-	**Additional Conditions**:
	-	+2 hours for crossing into a different country.
	-	+2 hours for traveling to a city with a population exceeding 200,000.

## ‚ú® Features
- Visualize the path on a 3D globe.
- Experiment with your own starting point and adjust constraints such as travel times and penalties.
- View cities and travel connections on an interactive map.
- Create custom GIFs to showcase your journey and exploration.
- Analyze the chosen path in detail, including every point‚Äôs neighbors, distances, and travel times.
- Learn more about the algorithms used.
